<div class="bodytext">
<p>Loglet Lab 2 is a Java version of the original Loglet Lab
software, rewritten from the ground up. Loglet Lab is also
available at no cost under a BSD-like license, so it can be used on
any platform that supports Java, including Windows, Mac OS X, and
Linux.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to guide you through the
installation and basic use of Loglet Lab. For more information on
how to use logistic anlaysis, you should read through the <a href=

<h1>About Loglet Lab</h1>
<a name="differences" id="differences"></a>
<h2>Differences from Loglet Lab 1.x</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Data entry interface.</b> Entering data in Loglet Lab 1.x
was not very intuitive. As part of the re-implementation, Loglet
Lab 2.x uses standard user interface compenents which makes
entering data much easier. Also, since many users already have
their data in Microsoft Excel and text documents, Loglet Lab 2.x
supports opening these files directly.</li>
<li><b>Fitting interface.</b> In Loglet Lab 1.x, fits were done
through a series of dialogs, which drew attention away from the
main interface. For Loglet Lab 2.x, we decided to take a more
direct approach by placing a fiting panel in the main window. The
fitting process itself has been streamlined, while at the same
time, the user has more control; you can change values and
instantly see the revised fit in the plot.<br />
<br />
Also, in Loglet Lab 1.x, statistical bootstrapping was provided as
a separate button in the interface. In Loglet Lab 2.x, this is
automatically done on every computer-generated fit (i.e., when you
click on the &quot;Fit&quot; button as opposed to using your own
values).</li>
<li><b>Export to PNG.</b> Many users wanted to add their graphs to
web pages and PowerPoint presentations. Loglet Lab can now save
their plots as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) images, which are
supported in the current versions of common office applications
(such as Microsoft Office) and web browsers (including Internet
Explorer, Netscape, and Safari).</li>
<li><b>Cross-platform availability.</b> Loglet Lab 1.x was only
available for Windows. However, we found that there were many users
who used Mac or Unix (particularly in the scientific community). By
re-implementing the application to Java, we can make Loglet Lab
available for many platforms.</li>
<li><b>Extensibility.</b> As part of the re-implementation, we also
redesigned the fitting process into modules. By implementing a few
common interfaces, new fitting models can be more easily integrated
into the code base. To this end, we plan to make the source code
available under a BSD-like license, which will allow others to add
their own ideas to the program. Because we have re-implemented in
Java, development can also take place on any platform.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<a name="sysreq" id="sysreq"></a>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>Again, because Loglet Lab is written entirely in Java, it can be
used on any platform that supports Java. We have tested it on
Windows 98, 2000, Mac OS X, and RedHat Linux.</p>
<p>To use Loglet Lab 2.x, you will need at least 32 MB RAM (128
recommended) and about 1 MB free space on your hard drive. In
addition, you must have a <b>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</b> v
1.4.1 or later. This will require another 50 MB free space on your
hard drive.</p>
<h3>Getting a JRE</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Windows or Linux users</b>: Java 1.4.1 JRE can be downloaded
from Sun at <a href=
"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html</a>.
Look under &quot;Download J2SE&quot;, and click on
&quot;DOWNLOAD&quot; under &quot;JRE&quot;, as highlighted in the
screenshot below. You do not need the full SDK.<br />
<img src="jdk_screenshot.png" alt=
"We recommend you download the JRE and not the full SDK." border=
"2" /></li>
<li><b>Mac OS X users:</b> Java support is built into the OS; if
you are running 10.2.x (Jaguar), you should run Software Update to
upgrade to Java 1.4.1 if you haven&#39;t already.</li>
</ul>
<a name="download" id="download"></a>
<h2>Download and Install</h2>
<p>Go to <a href=
"http://phe.rockefeller.edu/LogletLab/2.0/download.html">http://phe.rockefeller.edu/LogletLab/2.0/download.html</a>
to get the Loglet Lab package for your operating system. Windows
and Mac users can get an installer which will automate most of the
installation. Linux/Unix users can get a TAR file which contains
all of the necessary files to run Loglet Lab 2 (excluding the
JRE).</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>If you have a beta version of Loglet Lab 2 already installed on
your machine, we recommend uninstalling it. <i>Loglet Lab 2 will
not affect Loglet Lab 1 (a.k.a. &quot;Loglet Lab for
Windows&quot;).</i></p>
<p>To install Loglet Lab 2, double-click on
LL-&lt;<i>version-number</i>&gt;-install.exe. The installer will
guide you through the installation process; most users should be
able to use the default options. The installer creates an icon in
your desktop and a group in your Programs menu, which includes a
link to an uninstaller.</p>
<div class="c2"><img src="window_desktop.gif" />
<p class="c1">The Loglet Lab icon an a desktop.</p>
</div>
<h3>Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Double click on LogletLab-&lt;<i>version-number</i>&gt;.dmg.
This will mount the LogletLab image (a disk icon) on your desktop.
Double-click on that, and that will open a new Finder window with
LogletLab.pkg.</p>
<div class="c2"><img src="Installer1.png" />
<p class="c1">The Loglet Lab disk image.</p>
</div>
Double-click on LogletLab.pkg to run the installer, which will lead
you through the steps to install LogletLab.

<p class="c1">The Loglet Lab Installer for Mac OS X.</p>
</div>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Linux/Unix</h3>
<p>The Linux/Unix tarball will create a directory called
&quot;ll2/&quot; and put all of the necessary files in there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up a terminal a terminal window.</li>
<li>Make sure Java is available on your machine:<br />
<tt>java -version</tt></li>
<li><tt>cd &lt;directory where tarball was saved&gt;</tt></li>
<li>Unzip the tarball:<br />
<tt>tar xzf LogletLab2_&lt;<i>version-number</i>&gt;.tar.gz</tt>
(gzip version)<br />
<tt>tar xjf LogletLab2_&lt;<i>version-number</i>&gt;.tar.bz2</tt>
(bzip2 version)<br /></li>
</ol>
<h1>Your first loglet</h1>
<a name="startup" id="startup"></a>
<h2>Starting the application</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>To run Loglet Lab, double-click on the &quot;Loglet Lab 2&quot;
icon on your desktop, which you can also find in your Start Menu
under &quot;Start &gt; Programs &gt; Loglet Lab 2&quot;.</p>
<h3>Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Double-click on the LogletLab icon in the install directory to
launch.</p>
<h3>Linux/Unix</h3>
<p>In the ll2 directory, type <tt>./startLogletLab.sh</tt> to
launch Loglet Lab.</p>
<a name="newdoc" id="newdoc"></a>
<h2>New document/edit plot info</h2>
<p>Loglet Lab opens the last document you last opened or saved by
default. If this is your first time running Loglet Lab, the program
will create a new document. At that time, it will also ask you for
the title and axis labels. If you want to change these later, you
can do so by going into the <b>Edit</b> menu and selecting <b>Plot
Info...</b>.</p>
<div class="c2"><img src="new_doc.gif" />
<p class="c1">The New Document/Edit Plot Info dialog.</p>
</div>
<h3>Open a document</h3>
<p>Alternatively, if you already have data in a text file or Excel
spreadsheet, you can open that file. 
(Find out <a href="format">how to format your documents</a> below.)
Go to the <b>File</b> menu and
select <b>Open...</b> In the Open dialog, choose <b>All importable
files</b> or <b>All files</b>, select the file
(e.g.&quot;Sunflower.xls&quot;), then click <b>Open</b>.</p>
<div class="c2"><img src="open_dialog.png" />
<p class="c1">The Open dialog window.</p>
</div>
<p>To import correctly, the file must follow a strict format. Excel
(XLS) files should have two columns per data set, and text files
should have one (x,y) point per line, separated by commas or
whitespace or both.</p>
<a name="enterdata" id="enterdata"></a>
<h2>Enter data</h2>
<p>Entering data in LL2 is straightforward: enter x and y values in
the grid. When you enter an x or y value to the last row, a new row
will automatically be added to the table. You can also paste data
from a spreadsheet or text file (using the same format as per
above).</p>
<p>If you want to exclude a data point (say, to mask an outlier),
check the box in the <b>Exclude?</b> column. The corresponding
point will be drawn in red.</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="doafit" id="doafit"></a>
<h2>Do a fit</h2>
<p>Fitting models are objects in the new Loglet Lab, so one could
conceivably add different models (for example, simple least-squares
regression) to the program. Currently, the only fit models are the
two from the original version, logistic curves and logistic
substitution.</p>
<p>To add a logistic curve to the plot, select <b>Fit Logistic</b>
or <b>Fit Bilogistic</b> from the <b>Fit</b> menu. A panel will be
created above the graph, showing the parameters. Loglet Lab will
try to make a first guess at parameters, but you will probably have
to refine them, either by clicking on the <b>Fit</b> button and
letting Loglet Lab run its fitting algorithm, or by entering new
values or using the spinners (the arrows on the right of the text
field). Note that Loglet Lab&#39;s fitting algorithm is iterative;
you may have to click on the Fit button a few times before it
converges on its best value.</p>

</div>
<a name="saving" id="saving"></a>
<h2>Save your work</h2>
<p>To save your work, go to the <b>File</b> menu and select
<b>Save</b>. This will open a standard file dialog in which you
specify the name of your file. Loglet Lab 2 saves it as an XML
document, and will append an &quot;.xml&quot; extension if none is
entered in the Save dialog.</p>
<h2>Upload your work to the Loglet Lab gallery</h2>
<p>If you have an interesting logistic data set, we'd love to see it.
	You can upload your Loglet Lab 2 files to our web site
	(&lt;<a href="http://phe.rockefeller.edu/LogletLabWeb/">http://phe.rockefeller.edu/LogletLabWeb/</a>&gt;)
	and share it with	the community.  </p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<a name="logistic" id="logistic"></a>
<h2>Logistic curve fitting</h2>
<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
<p>After a fit, Loglet Lab will show a gray region which reflects
the statistical confidence of the estimated parameters. See the
Primer for a more detailed explanation of bootstrapping. This was a
suppplemental feature in Loglet Lab 1.x, but in the current
version it is now done automatically.</p>
<h3>Transforms</h3>
<p>When you have a logistic curve on the plot, you can transform
the data to get alternate views of the model. <b>Decomposed</b>
separates the logistic components and data and plots them
separately. <b>Fisher-Pry</b> also decomposes the components and
data, but it also normalizes the data to compare characteristics of
growth. <b>Bell curves</b> shows the rate of change of each
component.</p>
<h3>Constrained parameters</h3>
<p>To hold a parameter to a fixed value, check the box next to that
parameter. When you click on the Fit button, the fitting alorithm
will keep the value constant and fit the other parameters. Note
that checking the box will not prevent you from changing the value
manually, i.e., by entering a new value or clicking on its
spinner.</p>
<h3>CM method</h3>
<p>The <b>CM</b> button uses a method developed by Cesare Marchetti.
	If a data set grows logistically, then if the Fisher-Pry transformation is applied
	(using a hypothetical saturation (K) value), the data should appear linear on a
	semi-log plot.  This in mind, the Marchetti method attempts to fit a
	straight line to data transformed in this manner.  The main benefit to this
	over the Levenberg-Marquardt method used in the regular fit is that the
	latter  tends to overestimate the saturation level.</p>
<p>First, Loglet Lab selects several values for saturation (K).  
	For each K value, Loglet Lab applies a Fisher-Pry transformation is applied
to the data to linearize it (on a semi-log plot), then performs a least-squares
regression to fit a line to the transformed data.  Finally, Loglet Lab picks the "best" fit using
by putting chi-squared for each fit into incomplete gamma function and taking
the highest value.
<p>The Marchetti method also weights the middle points in the linear regression
	using a Gaussian distribution function.</p>
<a name="multi" id="multi"></a>
<h2>Multiple data sets</h2>
<p>To another data set to the plot, go to the <b>Edit</b> menu and
select <b>Add Data Set...</b>. Loglet Lab will ask you to name the
new data set; you can change this name later via the Edit Plot Info
dialog. Loglet Lab will create a second tab in the data pane on the
left side of the window. To switch between data sets, click on the
tabs above the table grid. That is, if you click on a tab, its data
will be shown in the grid.</p>
<a name="logsub" id="logsub"></a>
<h2>Logistic substitution</h2>
<p>To do logistic substitution, you first must have more than one
data set. Go to the <b>Fit</b> menu and select <b>Logistic
Substitution</b>. This will add the Logistic Substitution panel
above the plot, and transform the data into market shares. In the
Logistic Substitution model, trend lines are fitted to either the
ascending or descending set of data, so, in the panel, you need to
specify start and stop times between which a line would be fitted.
Always fit to an ascending part when one is available.</p>
<div class="c2"><img src="recmedia_logsub.gif" />
<p class="c1">Recording media</p>
</div>
<a name="autoscale" id="autoscale"></a>
<h2>Turning off autoscaling on the ranges</h2>
<p>To set the scale of an axis manually, go to the <b>Edit</b> menu
and select <b>Plot Info...</b>. In the section for the axis that
you wish to change, check the box next to <b>min</b> and enter the
minimum and maximum for the axis. To turn autoscaling on again,
re-open the Edit Plot Info dialog and uncheck the box.</p>
<a name="format"></a>
<h2>How to format text and Excel documents for Loglet Lab</h2>
<h3>Text documents</h3>
<p>Plain text documents should contain one (x,y) point per row.
	The coordinates can be comma- or whitespace- (space or tab) delimted.</p>
<p>A sample text file would start out something like the following:</p>
<div class="logletinfo">
	<pre>
1801.000000     25.000000
1804.000000     27.000000
1807.000000     29.000000
1809.000000     30.000000
1816.000000     31.000000
1817.000000     32.000000
1818.000000     33.000000
1819.000000     37.000000
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Excel documents</h3>
<p>Excel documents should contain one data set per sheet.
	If you want a title for the chart, enter it as the sheet name (on the tabs at the
	bottom of the sheet) Labels for the x- and y-axes are optional; 
	they must be in the first row.
	Rows without numerical data in the first two columns will be ignored.</p>
	<div class="logletinfo" align="center">
	<img src="excel_example.png" alt="Example of an Excel sheet" />
	</div>
<a name="printing" id="printing"></a>
<h2>Printing and Exporting</h2>
<p>You can print a hard copy by going to the <b>File</b> menu and
selecting <b>Print</b>. This opens the Print Setup dialog, then the
Print dialog. (This is a workaround, because Windows does not keep
the orientation selection from the Print dialog.)</p>
<p>To export the plot for using it on a web page or another program
like PowerPoint, go to the <b>File</b> menu and select
<b>Export</b>. Loglet Lab will open a standard file dialog where
you can enter the name of the file. Currently, Loglet Lab can only
export Portable Network Graphics (PNG) images, 800 x 600 pixels.
PNG is supported in most programs and web browsers.</p>
